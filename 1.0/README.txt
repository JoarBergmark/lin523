The main program can be used with default settings by running:
    python3 main.py

dataset_builder.py, mlm_train.py, trainer.py can all be used from the terminal,
but will need to be ran from within python3 to modify the default arguments.

Datasets will by default be saved in /data/datasets/ and models will be saved in
/models/
